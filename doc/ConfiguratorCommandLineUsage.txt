Using iTALC Configurator at the commandline
===========================================

This document describes how the iTALC Configurator can be used
to alter an iTALC installation at the command line.


Listing current configuration
-----------------------------

The current configuration with all keys and values can be listed via the
"ListConfig" command. It can be abbreviated with "-l".

Example:

   italc-configurator -ListConfig


This will give an output like

   ...
   Logging/LogLevel=1
   Network/CoreServerPort=11100
   Network/DemoServerPort=11400
   ...



Changing the value of a configuration property
----------------------------------------------

A the value of configuration property can be changed using the
"SetConfigValue" command. It can be abbreviated with "-s".

Examples:

  italc-configurator -SetConfigValue Logging/LogFileDirectory C:\temp
  italc-configurator -s Logging/LogLevel=4



Applying settings from settings file
------------------------------------

You can apply the settings previously saved in a settings file using the
"ApplySettings" command. It can be abbreviated with "-a".

Examples:

  italc-configurator -ApplySettings MyCustomSettings.xml



Importing a public key
----------------------

You can import a public key file which has been exported during the installation
of the iTALC master computer using the "ImportPublicKey" command. It can be
abbreviated with "-i".

You can omit the the second parameter which specifies the public key file if it
is located in the directory from which you launch iTALC Configurator. The
program will automatically search for a *.key.txt file. If it finds exactly one,
it'll import this one.

Examples:

  italc-configurator -ImportPublicKey MyPublicKey.key.txt
  italc-configurator -i
