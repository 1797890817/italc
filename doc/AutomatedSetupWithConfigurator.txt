Automated setup with iTALC Configurator
=======================================

iTALC Configurator allows to configure an iTALC installation easily.
The program provides an easy to use graphical user interface with all
iTALC-related settings.

This document describes how a computer can be setup for the use of iTALC
automatically. All instructions refer to an automated setup on Windows but
should be identical on Linux except platform-specific characteristics such
as path delimiter, installation paths etc.


1) Prepare a global common directory which can be accessed by all computers
   in the network. Alternatively, a directory on an USB drive works as well.


2) Install iTALC on the master computer. Afterwards run Configurator and
   alter the settings according to your needs and your environment.

   In the "Authentication" area, launch the iTALC access key assistant and
   let it create an access key pair and export the public key to the directory
   prepared in step 1)


3) Create an iTALC reference installation. Afterwards run Configurator and alter
   the settings according to your needs and your environment. Then save the
   settings via "File" -> "Save settings into file" to the directory prepared
   in step 1) and choose a filename, e.g. ItalcSettings.xml


4) Copy the content of the installation directory (e.g. all files in
   C:\Program Files\iTALC\) to the directory prepared in step 1).


5) Write a batch file with the following commands and place it in the same
   directory as the files in the previous steps.

     mkdir "C:\Program Files\iTALC"
     copy "%~dp0\*.exe" "C:\Program Files\iTALC"
     copy "%~dp0\*.dll" "C:\Program Files\iTALC"
     copy "%~dp0\*.txt" "C:\Program Files\iTALC"
     copy "%~dp0\*.xml" "C:\Program Files\iTALC"
     italc-configurator -ApplySettings ItalcSettings.xml
     italc-configurator -ImportPublicKey PublicKey.key.txt
     italc-service -RegisterService
     italc-service -StartService

   When calling Configurator for applying settings and importing the public key
   you can also pass "-silent" or "-quiet" in order to suppress any message
   boxes.

   After running this batch file on a computer, the computer should be ready for
   use with the iTALC network.
